Retro-fit looks and layout on your existing folders, using this template-based tool.

Do you want your Tracker folders to look perfect?
Perhaps you have lots of folders, and you want them all to look the same. If you want your folders to have a certain icon, set of columns, background, perhaps even some default content, FolderShaper lets you change all that in a snap. Create a perfect folder, add it as a FolderShaper template, then drop your folders on FolderShaper, and select the template from the popup menu. Voilà, your folders take on the looks of the template folder. FolderShaper also works as a Tracker add-on, if you prefer to use it that way.
